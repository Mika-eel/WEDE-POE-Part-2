PART 1-With Improvements 
NGO: Human Rights Institute of South Africa
The Human Rights Institute of South Africa, also known as HURISA, is a non-governmental organisation that was created by retired judge Richard Goldstone as the Institute for the Study of Public Violence. The Institute functioned as the Goldstone Commission of Inquiry's research and documentation branch about the prevention of intimidation and public violence. Mr. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, the pioneer of black democratic governance and anti-apartheid revolutionary, asked the Norwegian government for help in establishing a system that would effectively monitor politically motivated public violence, which was endangering South Africa's transition from apartheid to a peaceful constitutional democracy. HURISA has a mission to become the leading service provider of human rights, support through the development and delivery of equality training, advocacy, monitoring and research that respond to the specific human rights needs in not only South Africa but Africa as well.
A website acts as a focal point for showcasing the objectives, activities, and mission of HURISA. It informs the public about human rights issues and provides resources for getting engaged or supporting the cause. Transparency is demonstrated on a well-maintained website via the publication of impact stories, project updates, and financial data. With donors, partners, and the public, this foster trust. The website for HURISA can provide real-time updates, action alerts, and options for individuals to get engaged or support relief operations during emergencies or times of crisis, such as catastrophes involving abuses of human rights. It can help supporters feel more connected to one another by offering a forum for dialogue, interaction, and experience sharing on human rights activities. 
It offers a repository for papers, articles, and other instructional resources that help educate stakeholders, legislators, and the public on human rights issues and the activities of non-governmental organisations.
 
Vision: To establish a human rights culture in which individuals are aware of, comprehend, and have access to the institutions that uphold their rights in their local communities.
 Mission :Our mission is to provide expert services to advance a culture of human rights and peace in South Africa, the surrounding area, and the world.
