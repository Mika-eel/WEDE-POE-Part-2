        <p>The Rural Women Movement and the Human Rights Institute of South Africa worked together during the pandemic's peak in 2020. This was done in an effort to influence the human rights initiatives for women and children who reside in marginalised areas. Voices of Women Fighting the COVID-19 Epidemic and Supporting Communities adhere to procedures were brought up in order to be acknowledged as crucial service suppliers. Female business owners and financial assistance were given to informal traders so they may create face marks to give to volunteers and health facilities, and community GBV shelters.</p>
        
        <p>The organisation envisions a world in which everyone is aware of their rights as human beings, how to have those rights realised, and how to access channels for redress. In order to do this, the organisation aims to educate people about human rights as much as possible in South Africa and abroad, particularly with regard to socioeconomic rights, human rights systems, and human rights philosophy.</p>
        <p>HURISA is a part of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development's South Africa National Committee on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance. a participant in the steering committee for the creation of South Africa's national action plan on women, peace, and security in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1325. Her-Voice-Her-Peace-She-Matters is a campaign that HURISA organises to support women's voices and involvement in peace and security processes and initiatives. The organisation also oversees a youth learning exchange program in Kenya and South Africa. a supporter of national assessments for civil society organisations and the enabling environment as well as a member of the BRICS civil society.</p>
