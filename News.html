            <h2 class="subheading">Press Statement on the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples</h2>
            <p><strong>August 9, 2024</strong> - The African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights recognizes the role that the African Union, the United Nations, and civil society organizations have played in advancing and defending the rights of Indigenous Peoples both within and outside of Africa. The Commission joins the rest of the world in celebrating the progress made in this regard. Today is the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples.</p>
            
            <p>Despite the progress that has been accomplished in recent years, Indigenous Peoples around the world still struggle to promote and defend their rights as unique peoples. Various conditions that continue to make Indigenous Peoples weaker and less fortunate still exist today. The Commission is concerned by the numerous instances of forcible evictions against Native Americans and the data showing their restricted access to essential services, such as healthcare and education.</p>
            
            <h3>Education Challenges in South Africa</h3>
            <p>The Department of Basic Education's Education Facilities Management report revealed that 3,932 schools continued to utilize illegal pit latrines, infringing on students' rights to health, dignity, safety, and life, even though pledges had been made to eliminate and replace them by 2023.</p>
            
            <p>According to a 2030 Reading Panel assessment, 82% of Grade 4 students—up from 78% in the pre-pandemic period—were unable to read any language with meaning. The energy crisis also hampered access to education, exacerbating entrenched inequities as children showed up to school hungry and with incomplete assignments, sometimes even arriving late.</p>
            
            <h3>South Africa's Democratic Milestones</h3>
            <p>For South Africa and the Human Rights Institution of South Africa (HURISA), 2019 was significant in many ways. South Africa celebrated 25 years of independence as a democracy and human rights state. In 2019 and 2020, South Africa held a temporary membership in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and assumed the UNSC Presidency for a month in October 2019. Additionally, HURISA celebrated its 25th anniversary, marking its dedication to upholding human rights through activism, research, and educational programs.</p>
