        <p>August 9, 2024 - The African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights recognizes the role that the African Union, the United Nations, and civil society organizations have played in advancing and defending the rights of indigenous peoples both within and outside of Africa. The Commission also joins the rest of the world in celebrating the progress made in this regard. Today is International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples.
